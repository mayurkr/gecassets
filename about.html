<h3 align="center">Association Of Electronics And Telecommunication Engineering Students</h3>

<br>
<h5>Reg No: 297/Goa/2009</h6>
<br>
<br>
ASSETS is a non-profit organisation built for the overall growth of future electronics and telecommunication professionals. It aims at the growth of every students and their overall development as an individual, nurtured in all respect and made ready to face life.
<br>
<br>
We organise many activities and events ranging from college level to national and international events. Every year ASSETS organises "Technosangram" , a national level techfest. We also organise National and International level conferences like NCET and ICET. Many of our Faculty and students have presented papers and journals at such conferences and this adds to the credit of ASSETS. We are also planning to organise an Alumni meet in the upcoming year, which will give the students a broader view of how the industry works, after interacting with successful seniors.
<br>
<br>
ASSETS provides the students with interactive clubs to exploit their talent. We presently have The Photography Club and The Robotics Club. The Animation Club is expected to be set up very soon. These clubs are open to all students with interest in that particular field irrespective of branch or year. Club Meetings are held regularly wherein the experienced members provide guidance to the newly joined. The students participate in various competitions related to their field of interest. Workshops are also conducted to enhance the knowledge of beginners and also to create awareness amongst the promising future members.
<br>
<br>
ASSETS has a council body made up of students and a faculty in-charge to supervise its activities. The members are always ready to serve ASSETS and all its activities. We also have excellent faculty, lead by our HOD, who are always supportive and encourage students to give their best in whatever they do. Hence we are the brand "ASSETS".
<br>
<br>
Each elected council stays in power for a period of 1 year and the members are from second, third and fourth year, all working in harmony.
